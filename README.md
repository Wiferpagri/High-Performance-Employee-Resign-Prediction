# High Performance Employee Resign Prediction

High performance employee resign prediction using graphs (with node embeddings) and supervised learning. This data was taken from Indra Hackday 2024 - People Analytics. The winner from this competiton had 0.5614 F1 score on test data. Applying various techniques such as graph embeddings and Feature Engineering we were able to get 0.6106 F1 score using XGBoost Classifier.

Applying a dimensionality reduction technique named Recursive Feature Extraction with the XGBoost Classifier, the number of features (no node embeddings features included) was reduced from 50+ to only 21, finding that employee's seniority and the interaction between employee and boss gender are the most important features to predict the early resignation of an employee with high performance.
